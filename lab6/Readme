BUILDING AND RUNNING:

4 machines are used: flume, bear, carter, katahdin

Use make to compile. 
To run the application:
1, start the overlay processes:
	At each node, goto lab6 directory: run ./overlay/overlay
	The overlay processes on 4 nodes should be started within 1 min.
	wait until you see: waiting connection from network layer on all the nodes.
2. start the network processes: 
	At each node, goto lab6 directory: run ./network/network
	wait until you see: waiting for connection from SRT process on all the nodes.
3. start the transport processes and run the application:
	AT one node, goto server dicrectory: run ./app_simple_app or ./app_stress_app
	At another node, goto client directory: run ./app_simple_app or ./app_stress_app

To stop the program:
use CRTL + C to kill the network processes and overlay processes

If the port numbers used by the program are used already, the program exits.
