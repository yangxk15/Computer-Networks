//  SNP API for the client and server sides 
//  =======================================
//
//  In what follows, we provide the prototype definition for each call and limited pseudo code representation
//  of the function. This is not meant to be comprehensive - more a guideline. 
// 
//  You are free to design the code as you wish.
//
//  NOTE: snp_sendseg() and snp_recvseg() are services provided by the networking layer
//  i.e., simple network protocol to the transport layer. 
//
//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
//

int snp_sendseg(int connection, seg_t* segPtr);

// Send a SRT segment over the overlay network (this is simply a single TCP connection in the
// case of Lab3). TCP sends data as a byte stream. In order to send segments over the overlay TCP connection, 
// delimiters for the start and end of the packet must be added to the transmission. 
// That is, first send the characters ``!&'' to indicate the start of a  segment; then 
// send the segment seg_t; and finally, send end of packet markers ``!#'' to indicate the end of a segment. 
// Return 1 in case of success, and -1 in case of failure. snp_sendseg() uses
// send() to first send two chars, then send() again but for the seg_t, and, then
// send() two chars for the end of packet. 
//
//++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
//

int snp_recvseg(int connection, seg_t* segPtr);

// Receive a segment over overlay network (this is a single TCP connection in the case of
// Lab3). We recommend that you receive one byte at a time using recv(). Here you are looking for 
// ``!&'' characters then seg_t and then ``!#''. This is a FSM of sorts and you
// should code it that way. Make sure that you cover cases such as ``#&bbb!b!bn#bbb!#''
// The assumption here (fairly limiting but simplistic) is that !& and !# will not 
// be seen in the data in the segment. You should read in one byte as a char at 
// a time and copy the data part into a buffer to be returned to the caller.
//
// IMPORTANT: once you have parsed a segment you should call seglost(). Here is the code
// for seglost():
// 
// if segment is lost (we emulate that the packet is lost on the network) the return 1; 
// otherwise we assume that the packet is received OK and return 0
//
// int seglost() {
//	int random = rand()%100;
//	if(random<LOSS_RATE*100)
//		return 1;
//	else
//		return 0;
//}
