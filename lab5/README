The 4 hosts used to build overlay network is
tahoe.cs.dartmouth.edu
bear.cs.dartmouth.edu
green.cs.dartmouth.edu
katahdin.cs.dartmouth.edu

The overlay process should be running on these four hosts
to start overlay on a host:
Under lab5/ directory run ./overlay/overlay
All overlay process should be started within 1 min.

After all the overlay processes are started, start the network processes on all 4 nodes.
The network process should be started after the local overlay network is initialized and 
shows "Overlay: waiting for connection from SNP process..."
to start network layer on a host:
Under lab5/ directory run ./network/network

To kill the overlay processes and network processes: use kill -9 processID, or Ctrl + C

If the ports used by the program are used already, the program will exit.
