In this project, a completely different paradigm for synchronization of personal data across different devices is explored. Rather than relying on the centralized cloud, we enable local file exchange and synchronization across devices. Devices can directly talk to each other to obtain the latest files, and all files are stored locally. The resulting benefits are twofold. First, it naturally protects user's data privacy, since all data are stored locally and controlled by users, and no copies are made on centralized cloud. Second, it constraints traffic within a local network, which not only reduces the network traffic burden to remote cloud servers, but also leads to faster file synchronization by accessing local networks. This design paradigm is towards our vision of a "decentralized cloud".
