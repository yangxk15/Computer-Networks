Use the provided Makefile to build the code.  

There are two executables, a simple executable and a stress executable
for you to test with.

Just typing "make" will make both the simple and stress executables.  
"make simple" will build just the simple
version and "make stress" will build just the stress version.

Under the lab4/ directory:
Use ./client/simple_client to run the simple client and ./server/simple_server
to run the simple server.  The stress versions can be run in the same way
with simple replaced with stress.

top directory:
send_this_text.txt - simple test data
